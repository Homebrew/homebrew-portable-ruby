# Homebrew Portable Ruby (deprecated)

This tap was formulae and tools to build versions of Ruby that could be installed and run from anywhere on the filesystem.

It has now been moved into [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) and [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core).

Everything still works as before, it just isn't in this tap any more.
