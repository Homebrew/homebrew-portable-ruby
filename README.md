# Homebrew Portable
Formulae and tools to build versions of Ruby, Git and Curl that can be installed and run from anywhere on the filesystem.

## How do I install these formulae?
Just `brew install homebrew/portable/<formula>`.

## How do I build packages for these formulae?
### macOS
Run `brew portable-package <formula>`. Ideally inside an OS X 10.5 VM so it is compatible with old macOS versions.

### Linux
Run `brew portable-package <formula>`. Ideally this should be run inside the CentOS 5 Docker container with:
```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t homebrew-portable:latest .
docker run -t -i homebrew-portable /bin/bash
brew portable-package <formula>
```

macOS/OS X builds on 10.6 and newer target 32-bit/64-bit Intel Macs. OS X builds on 10.4 and 10.5 target 32-bit PowerPC and Intel Macs.

Linux builds target x86_64 platforms.

1. Single architecture only for macOS builds, as universal build is broken. It appears to be Ruby's bug, as it's fixed for Ruby 2.1.
2. `irb` on Linux builds seems to fail to link to ncurses statically. If `portable-ncurses` is removed, `irb` will fail to handle left, right or backspace keystroke.
